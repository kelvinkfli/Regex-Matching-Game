What the user sees:

    Essential Things:
    1. A bunch of strings/things to match
    2. input area for regex
    3. a submit button

    Things to add later:
    -scoreboard
    -cheatsheet
    -timed score deduction
    -browser change deduction
    -hints?

Essential Things:

1. create our own questions
    -var questionBank = {
        level1: [ [string1, string2, string3], string1, string2, string3],string1, string2, string3] ]
        level2: [string4, string5, string6],

    }

2. Input Area:
    -probably going to be a form
    -place for user to type regular expression
    -we want score to be calculated as user types
    -run a function that updates score

3. Submit Button:
    -on click, run a function that validates user input (is it right/wrong?)
    -if right, show next question
    -if wrong, keep trying
